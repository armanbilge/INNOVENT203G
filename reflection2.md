Hamish Nuttall, founder of NakedBus, and Brian Karlson, founder of TransferCar both capitalised on the transportation market, but the similarities between their companies and their journeys only begin there.
As I will discuss, the similarities include the market targeted, the resources on which the companies were built, and the environmental pressures and competition that they faced over time.
However, what makes drawing a comparison between NakedBus and TransferCar particularly interesting is the place that both companies have ended up.
While Nuttall has sold NakedBus to ManaBus, a competing company, TransferCar is still active under Karlson’s leadership and is expanding into new areas.
Identifying and analysing the differences between these two companies and how they were managed yields insight into what makes or breaks an entrepreneurial opportunity as a successful business.

NakedBus and TransferCar were in large part targeted at the same customers.
Not only did both companies have the goal of offering affordable transportation, but the distances over which they were offering the transportation are also very similar.
To make their products competitive, both companies took advantage of particular features of their chosen markets to lower costs.
NakedBus operated on the idea that cheaper tickets for early bookings help fill busses to capacity.
TransferCar capitalised on the fact that car rental companies needed help redistributing their vehicles across their locations and offering free rentals to customers who would drive the cars where needed.
This demonstrated how the structure of the market can in fact be taken advantage of to create new opportunities, and in particular that many competitive opportunities exist where customer’s money can be saved.
Furthermore, despite being focused on offering cheap transportation, this did not prevent the companies from becoming profitable.

Another important concept that both entrepreneurs demonstrated is the possibility to build a profitable company in a certain market without immediately investing into resources.
For example, all of the buses that NakedBus used were leased from and operated by other companies, such that NakedBus was operating as a middle man.
NakedBus could instead focus on streamlining the process and reducing costs by developing and implementing new technologies.
Very similarly, TransferCar in fact does not own a single car, but instead works with existing vehicle rental companies.
Again, TransferCar creates a technological bridge between the targeted customers and the rental companies.
However, Karlson was completely able to build this software without any development team of his own by outsourcing to development houses.
The important lesson that I took away from this is that very little physical resources are necessary to start running a company by being intelligent about how work and items are outsourced.
In addition, I believe that decisions like this also help control risk by offsetting these concerns to companies that are already focussed on these tasks.

Finally, NakedBus and TransferCar were both subject to potentially lethal competition.
In the case of NakedBus, it was the introduction of ManaBus to the market that brought its end.
TransferCar, on the other hand, was arguably always doomed because very little prevented car rental companies from performing themselves the services that they offered.

One of the key differences between NakedBus and TransferCar was the fervour with which they expanded.
While NakedBus was restricted entirely to New Zealand, Karlson described several pushes to expand TransferCar first to Australia and then to the USA.
The process of expanding TransferCar caused a number of major changes as the company was moved to the USA.
Furthermore, Karlson’s personal life as affected as he moved with the company.
In comparison, NakedBus’s growth was quite stagnant.
Although Nuttall injected several new ideas and technologies into the New Zealand transportation market, he did not describe efforts to bring these ideas to other markets abroad.
As it is too early to judge whether TransferCar’s rapid growth has done more good or created risk for the company in the long run, I would be hard-pressed to identify the best rate of expansion.
However, I take away the important of looking to new markets to expand your company in addition to incrementally improving on your current market.

The other primary difference between the two companies was how strongly they stuck to their original missions.
Somewhat surprisingly, given Nuttall’s dedication to the agile philosophy, NakedBus was always about bussing people around New Zealand.
TransferCar is perhaps at an entirely different extreme as Karlson is using it as a platform to launch a new business for delivering large items on weekends.
However, the important takeaway is that NakedBus was absorbed into ManaBus while TransferCar still exists as an independent business.
Therefore I learned from Karlson that building a company is in large part about building a team that is capable of doing good work over a short time period.
By using his existing TransferCar team he was able to rapidly start capitalising on a new business opportunity that he saw.
I think this idea is important to have up front because when making decisions about who to hire for a team, it is important to choose individuals who can help the business expand into new areas and have the knowledge and agility to work in different areas than perhaps their original job description.

In summary, the juxtaposition between NakedBus and TransferCar was extremely useful to consider.
The similar methods that both founders used to start their companies show how an entrepreneurial opportunity can be bootstrapped into a successful business with minimal resources or capital.
However, more importantly, the differences between how the companies grow demonstrated that expansion to new markets and the agility to tackle new problems are important to the long term survival of the company.
