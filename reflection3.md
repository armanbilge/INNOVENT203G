Working on The Challenge was an engaging and exciting experience.
I enjoyed developing a relationship with my group and felt inspired to exercise my entrepreneurial mindset.
Most importantly, I feel these experiences will have an important impact on my life and career post-graduation.

One of the most meaningful moments for me was organising our first group meeting.
We were about one week into The Challenge and had not yet met.
I decided to book a room in the OGGB before the first speaker event and sent an email to all of my team members simply stating the place and time of our meeting.
I was concerned that my action was too assertive, so I was happily surprised to receive a positive and eager response from everyone.
In reflection, I understand that I recognised the opportunity to meet before the event, took the initiative to make it happen, and also assessed and taken the risk of my proposed meeting falling through.
The fact that of my group members were present and on time built a foundation of my trust for them and their commitment to the group and our project.
I also felt that they developed a trust for me as they relied on and expected me to book a room for our meeting each week, and with that trust I gained responsibility and a sense of ownership for that task.
Their commitment and trust demonstrated to me that my group members had an entrepreneurial mindset and encouraged me to continue developing my own.
From this I take away the importance of taking initiative, even if it is as mundane as booking a room, and in the future I will be more optimistic with regard to the response I expect from my peers and team mates.

I attribute one of the key reasons our group had success on The Challenge was our ability to think strategically and make goals.
At the beginning of every meeting we reviewed upcoming deadlines and decided what we wanted to achieve by the end of our meeting.
Meetings ended with confirmation of what each of us needed to have ready for our meeting the following week.
I have seen the effectiveness of this strategy in other contexts:
this summer I spent three weeks visiting a research group at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center where every member posted a beginning-of-day and end-of-day goals and achievements message to a group chat.
Based on these experiences, I believe that by explicitly stating your goals, whether for a meeting, day, or year, one can greatly increase your productivity in a measurable fashion.
Furthermore, making these in a public forum helps to foster a sense of ownership to the goals and commitment to seeing them achieved.
Finally, the regularity of our meetings bolstered our diligence to stick to our long-term strategy and feel responsibility to each other and the group as a whole.

The diversity of our team was crucial to our ability to take a creative approach to problem solving.
This idea ties in with the concept that having a versatile team can help a new business expand quickly and effectively into new areas, which I took away from the speaker series.
But more surprisingly, I found a unique niche in my group as the only science student working on a wicked problem largely motivated by modern scientific understanding.
This folds out in two ways.
The first was that, while I still reported back to my team, I felt a strong sense of independence in my efforts to review the technical and scientific aspects of the project.
Secondly, I was forced to grow my capacity for negotiation and persuasion as I had to explain my knowledge and technical understanding to group members with quite different background to mine.
Initially, I did not appreciate how much of entrepreneurship rests on communication skills and the ability to put across my ideas in a convincing and understandable manner.
My most important realisation is that comprehensibility precedes being accurate or correct down to every small detail.
This often meant avoiding technical jargon and focussing on analogies and images that people can relate to.
In addition to enabling me to share my ideas, I also discovered that it helped my team members develop trust for me as they saw me as down to earth (as opposed to arrogant).
I will continue using this communication strategy when speaking about technical subjects due to its effectiveness, and especially when trying to explain a scientific concept in a convincing and believable manner.

In summary, my involvement with The Challenge provided me an arena to exercise the entrepreneurial mindset, see it in my team members, and moreover experience the positive outcomes associated with it.
While it was beneficial to understand the theory behind entrepreneurship and hear the stories of several successful entrepreneurs, it was very fulfilling to find myself applying the same skills, attributes, and behaviours as part of The Challenge.
In addition to my deeper understanding and appreciation for the entrepreneurial mindset, perhaps my greater outcome will be the ability to work alongside and respect people with different backgrounds, skills and interests.
I am confident that the mindset I have adopted will have an significant impact on my life.
Although I am pursuing a career in scientific research, I have discovered it is in fact quite similar to entrepreneurship.
Important research also often deals with wicked problems, and good scientists demonstrate many aspects of the entrepreneurial mindset, including creative problem solving, self believe, and independence.
Furthermore, science depends heavily on funding which is competitive to get and depends on the quality and persuasiveness of research proposals.
Having had a chance to develop these skills from my experiences while working on The Challenge, I suspect that I will have a considerable advantage over my peers in science as I progress in my career.
I plan to use these experiences boldly to help achieve my goals throughout my life.
