Carmen Vicelich and her business, Data Insight NZ, struck me as an unusual pair.
Initially describing herself as a mother, to found her business she embarked on a journey that involved surmounting several seemingly impossible challenges.
Although increasing in numbers, female leaders in the information technology business are generally rare and undeniably face conscious and unconscious sexism.
Her most recent venture at Data Insight NZ, Valocity, is Property Valuation System customised to the New Zealand market.
She has successfully navigated an arena consisting of the fields of finance, law, statistics, and information technology to not only create this product but also sell it to clients.
Her greatest strength is a relentless and even self-admittedly insane determination to sideline every setback she faced.

Like other successful entrepreneurs, Vicelich identified an significant opportunity in the marketplace.
However, Vicelich's story begins at PropertyIQ, where she worked prior to starting Data Insight NZ.
I was surprised when I learned that her idea was simply to build a business around a service that PropertyIQ did not offer but was frequently asked of by its clients.
While the romanticised entrepreneur may develop a totally novel business model which they drop out of university to pursue, her story demonstrates that a successful venture can just as easily sprout from an existing company.
This notion is in line with the idea that is very easy to forget that the best ideas may otherwise come from mundane sources.

I was absolutely blown away by Vicelich's persistance.
She pursued a high-risk business idea: there was already competition and she was treading close to the area of her prior company.
Moreover, she needed skills that she personally had no experience with.
For example, her journey to find programmers for her business even took her abroad and seemed promising, but eventually fell through.
Despite this set back, she found a way to make her own team and find her own talent.
In a similar light, because her industry involves several financial institutions and experts, she had difficulty getting them on board without each other.
In other words, she described this as a chicken-and-egg problem that in my opinion was seemingly impossible.
However, by playing her cards right she was able to bring the right components together.

Once she realised that she had no option but to assemble her own team of programmers, she made a point of finding the best talent no matter the cost.
In addition to going after the best employees for her business, Vicelich also demonstrated a knack for finding the best mentors and advisors.
In all of these cases, she considered her business to already be a success and went looking for people in light of this assumption.
The importance of finding and surrounding yourself with the best people possible is something I understand.
The entire reason I came to study abroad in New Zealand was to be alongside specific faculty and students who are world experts in my field of interest.
The experiences I have had as a result of this decision, and everything that I have learned, demonstrates the value of building the right community of people around yourself.
As she mentioned this in talk, I was reminded to keep applying this idea as I decide where to continue to after I graduate.

I also identified strongly with Vicelich's philosophy that failure is simply not an option.
She demonstrated this idea in at least a couple of instances.
The first was when she had a meeting a client that wanted to see a working product, which at the time was hardly in development.
She had no choice but to commission to her team to put together a minimal working example over the course of a couple of days, but ultimately this was successful.
The second instance was when she was asked to present a backup strategy to her board should they not be able to get a particular client.
Again, she decided that they were going to get this client: failure was not an option, and thus she did not fail.
My own greatest successes have been more than goals; they have been milestones that I have decided to achieve and given myself no option but to follow through.
I believe this is because if you decide something and continue reinforcing the belief that it is true, it helps build the confidence necessary to make it come true.

Vicelich reminded me the incredible importance of relentless pursuit of your dreams.
She thought big and did everything possible and impossible to make it happen.
Although she individually is no expert in many of the fields she interacts with, by finding the right people both below and above her she was able to accomplish her vision.
Personally, I will focus on building relationships with people that I know can support my own entrepreneurial goals.
